        <h2>Capture the Flag (CTF)</h2>
        <p>
          My first CTF was at <strong>Galway University</strong>, which got me hooked on hands-on security.
          My second was <strong>Zero Days</strong>, where our team <strong>ranked in the open category</strong>.
          These events sharpened skills in web, crypto, reversing, OSINT, and fast teamwork under pressure.

      <!-- Essentials to Entrepreneurship -->
      <article style="margin-bottom:2rem; width:100%;">
        <h2>Essentials to Entrepreneurship (UCD Innovation Academy)</h2>
        <p>
          I completed <strong>Essentials to Entrepreneurship</strong> in the <strong>Innovation Academy at UCD</strong>, 
          an experiential course designed to help students think and work like entrepreneurs. We spent significant time 
          learning the mindset through <strong>lessons</strong> (customer discovery, value propositions, business models, 
          branding, and pitching), <strong>activities</strong> (rapid prototyping, market interviews, and testing assumptions), 
          and structured <strong>reflections</strong> that pushed us to iterate and improve based on evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          We then put those skills into practice with a team project. Our brief was to design a product that is 
          <strong>sustainable</strong>, <strong>ready-to-eat</strong>, and <strong>attractive to the Irish market</strong>. 
          Our team created <strong>Spraoi Pots</strong> (“Spraoi” means fun in Irish): a premium Greek yogurt paired with granola. 
          The concept focuses on <strong>locally sourced ingredients</strong>, <strong>eco-friendly packaging</strong>, and a 
          social impact model where a portion of revenue supports <strong>Irish farmers</strong>. We explored positioning Spraoi Pots 
          as a <em>protein-forward, grab-and-go</em> option for students, athletes, and health-conscious consumers, with an initial 
          channel strategy of high-end markets and fairs before scaling to retailers.
        </p>

        <p>
          As part of the project, we developed branding, unit economics, and a go-to-market plan, then delivered a final pitch to the class.

        <p>
          I’m involved in Lacrosse, Networking Society, Women in STEM, 
          Sub-Aqua, AI in Medicine, and Mountaineering.
          I serve on the executive committee of the brand-new <strong>AI in Medicine</strong> club, focusing on
          the <strong>computer science</strong> side and collaborating with technical partners. The society is
          still being set up, and details are actively being worked out.
