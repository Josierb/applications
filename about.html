      <p class="about-description">I'm a student at University College Dublin, studying Computer Science with Data Science. I started my computer science journey in my first year of high school, and have been in love with it since. I'm interested in many aspects of the field, and enjoy exploring different areas of it. Outside of computer science, I'm interested in scuba diving, lacrosse, field hockey, travelling, and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
